                                <p>I graduated with a Second Class Honours Grade One (2.1) in BSc Computer Applications and Software Engineering from Dublin City University (DCU). During my studies, I gained a solid foundation in programming languages and technologies, including Python, Java, C++, SQL, R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This diverse technical background has provided me with the tools to approach complex challenges with analytical rigor and technical proficiency.<br><br>
                                    My time at DCU also taught me how to collaborate effectively in team environments, adapt to new technologies, and communicate technical concepts clearly—skills that are equally valuable in client-facing roles like Tech Sales. The experience instilled in me a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems and a strong foundation for bridging the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders.

                                    <p>The Driver Drowsiness Detection App (DRIV) is an Android application I developed as part of my final year project at Dublin City University. Leveraging facial recognition technology, the app monitors drivers for signs of fatigue, such as prolonged eyelid closure or head movements indicative of drowsiness. When drowsiness is detected, the app provides real-time alerts to ensure driver safety and prevent accidents. This project showcased my ability to combine technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and user-focused design to create a practical solution to a critical road safety issue.</p>
